üí° Cursor Usage and Rules Best Practices: A Practical Guide for Efficient AI Coding

Whether you're debugging complex code, refactoring legacy systems, or developing from scratch, Cursor can dramatically enhance your productivity. But to truly get the most out of it‚Äîwhile also keeping your costs under control‚Äîyou need to understand how to use it wisely.

In this post, we'll break down rules configuration, chat history, model warm-up, context limits, mode selection, and cost-saving tips. Let's dive in. üëá

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Setting Rules: Precision Over Generalization

Rules in Cursor help shape the way models understand and respond to your code. The more relevant and specific they are, the better the output.

Tips for Effective Rule Usage:
	‚Ä¢	Add rules that reflect the unique characteristics of your project.
	‚Ä¢	General rules provide broad context, but precise, scoped rules are often more effective.
	‚Ä¢	Limit rules to specific files or folders whenever possible.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid redundancy‚Äîcommon best practices are already part of the model's system prompt.
	‚Ä¢	Too many rules can make the model overly deterministic, reducing its creativity and problem-solving flexibility.

‚∏ª

üíæ Caching & Chat History: Smarter, Cheaper Requests

Cursor caches your chat history, which reduces token usage for future requests and allows the model to build a richer understanding of your codebase.

Benefits:
	‚Ä¢	Lower costs for subsequent prompts
	‚Ä¢	Better context-aware responses
	‚Ä¢	Stronger memory of your project's structure and intent

üí° Tip: Organize your chats meaningfully‚Äîe.g., per feature or module‚Äîfor clearer continuity.

‚∏ª

üîß Model Warm-up & Context Management

To get the best out of models like GPT-4, Gemini, or Sonnet, it's important to prime them properly and use context smartly.

Best Practices:
	‚Ä¢	Warm-up the model: Use a small prompt or summary to orient the model before hitting it with a big ask.
	‚Ä¢	Be selective with files: Including too many files increases token usage and can overwhelm the model.
	‚Ä¢	Gemini generally sticks to selected files, while Sonnet can pull additional context on its own.
	‚Ä¢	Only include what's necessary‚Äîextra context often adds cost without benefit.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Normal Mode vs. Max Mode

Cursor offers two execution modes: Normal Mode and Max Mode, each suited for different scenarios.

‚Ä¢  The only difference between Normal Mode and Max Mode is the amount of context they can handle. There is no difference in intelligence or model quality.

When to Use Max Mode:
	‚Ä¢	You need to include a large amount of context (e.g., many files, big classes).
	‚Ä¢	You're making use of features like:
	‚Ä¢	Larger context windows
	‚Ä¢	Up to 200 tool calls without continuation prompts
	‚Ä¢	Reading up to 750 lines from a file in one go

üí° But use with caution: Most of the time, a rich chat history is all you need. Max Mode is expensive‚Äîuse it when it's truly justified.

‚∏ª

üí∏ Cost Optimization & Token Usage

AI isn't free‚Äîevery token counts. Here's a practical breakdown of Cursor's pricing structure:
	‚Ä¢	1 million tokens ‚âà ~30,000‚Äì50,000 lines of code (assuming ~80 characters per line)
	‚Ä¢	Cursor charges the underlying API provider's cost plus a 20% margin
	‚Ä¢	One request ‚âà $0.04
	‚Ä¢	Normal Mode: ~2 requests per interaction
	‚Ä¢	Max Mode: ~7.78 requests per interaction

Pro Tip:

If the model fails to fix a bug after 3 attempts, don't keep retrying endlessly. Instead:
	‚Ä¢	Start a new chat
	‚Ä¢	Switch the model, if needed
	‚Ä¢	Provide a high-level overview first
	‚Ä¢	Then zoom in on the bug

This often results in a faster, more cost-effective resolution.

‚∏ª

‚öñÔ∏è Final Thoughts

AI coding assistants like Cursor are powerful‚Äîbut only if used wisely. Think of your prompts and file selections like writing code: be precise, intentional, and lean.

By applying the above practices, you'll not only reduce costs but also get better code, faster.
