Remote interviews are now the norm, with 83% of Australian companies expected to employ over 60% remote workers by 2025. But they come with challenges that can derail hiring success. Here's how to avoid the most common mistakes:

-   **Bad Technical Setup**: Test your internet, webcam, and microphone before the interview. Keep a backup device ready.
    
-   **Confusing Communication**: Speak clearly, use structured answers (e.g., [STAR method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result)), and practise active listening.
    
-   **Time Zone Mix-ups**: Confirm interview times in AEST, and use calendar tools to avoid confusion.
    
-   **Missing Communication Style Cues**: Research the company's tone and mirror the interviewer's style.
    

The key to success? Preparation, professionalism, and clear communication. Whether you're a candidate or an employer, refining these skills ensures smoother remote interviews and better outcomes.

## Remote Interview Mistakes and How to Fix Them

Remote interviews can be tricky to navigate, especially when small missteps snowball into bigger distractions. Below are four common mistakes you might encounter, along with practical ways to handle them. Addressing these issues can help ensure your virtual interviews run smoothly.

### Bad Technical Setup

Did you know that technical glitches impact nearly 30% of candidates during remote interviews? From unstable internet to outdated software or malfunctioning equipment, these issues can derail the conversation and shift the focus away from showcasing your skills [\[3\]](https://brainsource.io/virtual-interview-mistakes).

**The fix:**

-   Test your setup at least 10 minutes before the interview. This includes checking your internet connection, webcam, and microphone [\[4\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/9-remote-interview-best-practices-employers-muhammad-suhail-9qnrf).
    
-   Download and install the required video software well in advance, and run a practice session to familiarise yourself [\[2\]](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/best-practices-for-virtual-interviews-make-a-great-impression).
    
-   Always have a fully charged backup device handy in case your primary setup fails [\[3\]](https://brainsource.io/virtual-interview-mistakes).
    
-   Close unnecessary tabs and apps to improve your connection stability [\[4\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/9-remote-interview-best-practices-employers-muhammad-suhail-9qnrf).
    

### Confusing Communication

In a virtual setting, unclear communication can create unnecessary confusion. Whether it's speaking too fast, mumbling, or giving disorganised answers, these habits can lead to misunderstandings.

**The fix:**  
Speak at a steady pace and enunciate your words. Use structured approaches like the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to organise your responses. This makes your answers easier to follow and ensures you're covering all the key points. Additionally, practice active listening to avoid missing important cues [\[5\]](https://algocademy.com/blog/how-to-communicate-effectively-in-remote-interviews-a-comprehensive-guide).

### Time Zone Mix-ups

Scheduling can be a headache when dealing with Australia's multiple time zones. Misjudging time differences or failing to confirm details can lead to missed interviews or last-minute rescheduling, which might come across as unprofessional.

**The fix:**  
Always confirm interview times in AEST and double-check the time zone of the interviewer. Calendar tools that automatically adjust for time zones can save you from unnecessary confusion.

### Missing Communication Style Cues

Remote interviews often involve bridging gaps in communication styles. If you don't pick up on the tone or preferences of the interviewer, it could create a disconnect. Researching the company's communication norms beforehand can make a big difference.

**The fix:**  
Review the company's website, social media, or LinkedIn profiles to get a sense of their communication style. During the interview, mirror the tone of the interviewer and use straightforward language, avoiding unnecessary jargon [\[6\]](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/youre-navigating-remote-interviews-global-dxh7e). It's also helpful to ask about the team's preferred communication and collaboration practices.

> "Effective communication in remote interviews with global candidates requires a deep understanding of cultural nuances. Different cultures have varying communication styles, expectations, and interpretations, which can impact the interview process." - Swagatam Ghosh [\[6\]](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/youre-navigating-remote-interviews-global-dxh7e)

## Tools and Methods for Better Remote Interviews

When it comes to remote interviews, having the right tools and preparation strategies can make a huge difference. In fact, **75% of recruitment professionals highlight time savings as the biggest advantage of digital interview platforms** [\[7\]](https://hirevire.com/blog/best-digital-interview-platforms). So, being well-prepared benefits both candidates and interviewers alike.

### Using Reliable Platforms

A reliable video platform is the backbone of a smooth remote interview. Options like [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com/), [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), or [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) are popular choices, offering features such as automated transcription and candidate evaluation tools. These tools not only save time but also enhance the overall interview process. With the video interviewing software market expected to reach nearly $892 million by 2030 [\[7\]](https://hirevire.com/blog/best-digital-interview-platforms), the importance of these platforms is clear.

When choosing a platform, make sure it integrates seamlessly with your existing systems and offers dependable support. Test it thoroughly on different devices and browsers to avoid any last-minute surprises.

> "All you can look for in a video interview and candidate screening tool: Simple, intuitive, and stable. The quality of video and audio has been excellent, allowing us to properly assess communication skills essential for our client-facing roles." - Yusuf Mansur Özer, Hiring Partner [\[7\]](https://hirevire.com/blog/best-digital-interview-platforms)

For Australian startups or businesses building remote teams, sticking to a consistent platform not only ensures professionalism but also minimises technical hiccups. Alongside a strong platform, having well-organised digital resources can further streamline the process.

### Getting Digital Files Ready

Preparation extends beyond the platform - having all necessary documents ready is equally important. Interviewers should organise CVs, portfolios, and other materials in accessible formats like PDF, Word, or plain text [\[8\]](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/best-practices-for-virtual-interviews-top-tips-for-success)[\[9\]](https://www.apollotechnical.com/remote-interview-best-practices). This way, compatibility issues are avoided, regardless of the platform.

For portfolio work, cloud-based solutions are ideal. They allow quick screen sharing without the hassle of transferring large files. If you're the one conducting the interview, practise using the platform's file sharing and screen sharing features beforehand. A stable internet connection capable of handling both video streaming and file sharing is also essential.

> "By taking the time to thoroughly prepare your technology and having backup plans in place, you can focus on delivering a confident and professional virtual interview performance, without being derailed by technical hiccups." [\[8\]](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/best-practices-for-virtual-interviews-top-tips-for-success)

This attention to detail ensures a smoother interview experience for everyone involved.

### Practising Your Answers

Remote interviews come with their own set of challenges, so practising your answers is crucial. Using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) can help you structure your responses clearly and concisely, which is especially useful on video calls [\[10\]](https://remote.com/blog/jobs-talent/remote-job-interview-tips).

Record yourself answering common interview questions to evaluate your body language, tone, and eye contact. Remember to look directly at the camera rather than at your screen - it creates the impression of direct engagement. Keep your responses detailed but to the point, as overly long answers can feel even more drawn out in a virtual setting.

> "When interviewing over Zoom, you're not only worried about your responses to the questions but potentially instability when it comes to technology." - Anastasia Pshegodskaya, senior recruiting manager at Remote [\[10\]](https://remote.com/blog/jobs-talent/remote-job-interview-tips)

Remote communication also introduces unique hurdles, like slight audio delays that can disrupt the flow of conversation. Practising with these factors in mind - pausing slightly longer between responses and asking for clarification when needed - can make a big difference. Considering that **46% of candidates are more likely to be interested in jobs that include video interviews** [\[7\]](https://hirevire.com/blog/best-digital-interview-platforms), a polished remote interview performance is key to standing out. With practice, you'll be better equipped to handle these challenges and deliver a strong impression.

## Australian Remote Interview Tips

Navigating remote interviews in Australia requires an understanding of local norms and practices. These nuances can help you avoid common pitfalls and ensure effective communication during virtual hiring processes.

### Using Australian Formats

Familiarity with Australian conventions is essential for clarity. For instance, use the **DD/MM/YYYY** date format when scheduling or referencing dates. Write dates like "31 December 2024" in text, and "4/6/2021" in tables [\[14\]](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time). Always specify the time zone, such as **AEST** or **AEDT** - for example, "15:30 AEDT." When noting time, include a colon between hours and minutes, like "8:22 am" [\[14\]](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time).

> "Write, abbreviate and punctuate dates and times consistently so people can understand your content." [\[14\]](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time)

If salary discussions arise, always use "A$" to indicate Australian dollars [\[15\]](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/currency). These small details show professionalism and respect for local standards.

### Meeting Australian Business Expectations

Local business etiquette in Australia places high value on punctuality and clear communication. Joining a video call on time is crucial, as even a slight delay can leave a negative impression [\[16\]](https://www.kbs.edu.au/blog/career/australian-work-culture-things-you-need-to-know). Australians appreciate a direct yet polite communication style - be concise and to the point without being abrupt [\[16\]](https://www.kbs.edu.au/blog/career/australian-work-culture-things-you-need-to-know).

Professional appearance is equally important. Dress as you would for an in-person interview, and begin with a polite greeting to set a positive tone [\[12\]](https://www.nsw.gov.au/employment/my-career-planner/getting-a-job/job-interviews/remote-job-interviews). Australian workplaces often emphasise teamwork and collaboration over individual accomplishments, so demonstrating your ability to work effectively in diverse teams is key [\[16\]](https://www.kbs.edu.au/blog/career/australian-work-culture-things-you-need-to-know). Additionally, be prepared to discuss how you maintain a healthy work–life balance, as this aligns with local values [\[16\]](https://www.kbs.edu.au/blog/career/australian-work-culture-things-you-need-to-know).

### Supporting Ethical Hiring Practices

Ethical hiring practices are a priority for Australian businesses, reflecting values of fairness and inclusivity. For example, [Yaama Tech](https://yaama.tech/)'s client-led remote staffing model ensures that talent is paid fairly and above market rates, while startups benefit from access to global expertise at reduced costs.

This approach aligns with Australia's commitment to equality, treating all employees with respect regardless of gender, age, or race [\[16\]](https://www.kbs.edu.au/blog/career/australian-work-culture-things-you-need-to-know). In remote interviews, it's important for both parties to respect cultural diversity and adapt to different communication styles [\[17\]](https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/article/cultural-awareness-in-the-workplace-a-comprehensive-guide).

> "Employees have experienced the benefits of remote work firsthand, with many reluctant to give them up. To ensure top talent don't leave an organisation for this reason, companies should aim to strike a balance where workers still feel a level of autonomy and an in-office work environment that sparks enthusiasm, not dismay." – Nicole Gorton, a director at Robert Half [\[13\]](https://www.staffingindustry.com/news/global-daily-news/remote-work-remains-key-factor-for-australian-workers)

Australian companies increasingly prioritise skills and cultural alignment over physical location [\[1\]](https://www.remotestaff.com.au/blog/remote-work-major-role-2025-hiring-strategies). Clear communication about remote work arrangements is vital. Interviewers should outline whether the role is fully remote, hybrid, or requires occasional on-site presence, along with expectations for working hours and resources [\[11\]](https://www.mtcrecruitment.com.au/blog/2024/12/navigating-the-remote-hiring-landscape-insights-and-best-practices-for-virtual-recruitment). For candidates, researching the company's values and asking thoughtful questions about its work culture demonstrates respect for local business practices [\[16\]](https://www.kbs.edu.au/blog/career/australian-work-culture-things-you-need-to-know).

## Conclusion

Remote interviews come with their own set of hurdles, from technical glitches and cluttered backgrounds to time zone misunderstandings and missed communication cues. These challenges can trip up even the most qualified candidates or cause employers to overlook top-tier talent.

Success in remote interviews boils down to three main principles: **thorough preparation**, **professional presentation**, and **clear communication**. This means testing your tech setup, researching the company thoroughly, and maintaining steady eye contact through the camera. These small but essential steps can make a big difference in a virtual setting.

The numbers speak for themselves: 75% of hiring managers see a lack of professionalism during virtual interviews as a major warning sign, 58% cite poor lighting or distracting backgrounds as deal-breakers, and 64% favour candidates who maintain eye contact through the camera lens [\[3\]](https://brainsource.io/virtual-interview-mistakes). For Australian startups, these statistics highlight the importance of a polished, strategic approach to remote hiring.

<FAQ question="How do I make sure my tech setup is ready for a remote interview?">
To make sure your technical setup is ready for a remote interview, start by checking your internet connection. Aim for a stable speed of at least **25 Mbps** for both downloading and uploading. If possible, use a wired connection, as it's generally more reliable than Wi-Fi.

Test your webcam and microphone in advance to confirm they're functioning properly. Set up in a quiet, well-lit area - natural light works best to ensure you're clearly seen. It's also smart to have a backup plan, like a secondary device or a mobile hotspot, in case any unexpected technical issues arise.

Taking these steps can help you stay prepared and avoid interruptions during your interview.

<FAQ question="How can I communicate effectively during a remote interview?">
To make the most out of a remote interview, start by double-checking your tech setup. Ensure your microphone, camera, and internet connection are functioning properly - nothing derails an interview faster than technical hiccups. Set yourself up in a quiet, well-lit space with a simple, neutral background to keep the focus on you and minimise distractions.

When it's time to speak, aim for clarity and brevity. Look directly at the camera to create the impression of **eye contact** - it's a small but powerful way to connect with your interviewer. Sit up straight, use open body language, and nod occasionally to show you're actively engaged in the conversation. If a question catches you off guard, take a moment to gather your thoughts before responding. Thoughtful answers often leave a stronger impression than rushed ones.

These small but intentional steps can help you stand out and build a genuine connection, even through a screen.

<FAQ question="How can I manage time zone differences when scheduling remote interviews in Australia?">
Managing time zone differences for remote interviews in Australia doesn't have to be complicated. Start by using a reliable time zone converter or scheduling tool that factors in Australia's three main time zones: **AEST (UTC+10:00)**, **ACST (UTC+09:30)**, and **AWST (UTC+08:00)**. This ensures everyone is on the same page when it comes to timing.

Be clear about the time zone for all proposed interview slots to prevent any mix-ups. Offering several time options can also make it easier to accommodate participants across different regions. Once a time is agreed upon, confirm it in writing and include the relevant time zone. A bit of flexibility and clear communication can go a long way in ensuring a smooth scheduling process without unnecessary hiccups.
