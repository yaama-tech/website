Instruction for creating a new blog post:

- Make sure you have the following information otherwise ask the user to provide that information to you: Date, Slug
- Ask for the blog content.
- Identify the opening part of the blog to be used as {excerpt} excluding the title
- The rest of the blog excluding the title will be used as {body}
- Create a new folder under `/src/blog` called `{date}-{slug}` for example `2025-04-10-how-remote-developers-can-be-rockstar-team-players-practical-tips-that-work`
- Create a file under that folder called `index.mdx`
- No need to fill in the information that you don't have.
- You are just creating a placeholder and user will add the content. Do not generate the content 
- If user has provided tags then check the tag file at [tags.yml](mdc:src/blog/tags.yml) and add any of the tags that is missing to the tag file following the same pattern as the other tags. 
- Populate the file using the template below.
- Review the content, and if there are any FAQs, replace it using the FAQ component. For example:
```
<FAQ question="Question?">
Answer
</FAQ>
```
- Use CTA banner component to place 3 call-to-action components with proper messaging that matches the context of the blog: 
  - First one right after truncate tag `<!-- truncate -->` 
  - another one somewhere in the middle 
  - and last one towards the end of the article
  - Here is an example of using CTA banner components. 
  ```
  <CTABanner
  title="Ready to Transform Your Remote Onboarding?"
  subtitle="Partner with experts to create a scalable, engaging onboarding process that drives retention and productivity."
  buttonText="Talk to Remote Team Experts"
/>
  ```
